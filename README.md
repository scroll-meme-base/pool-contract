## Introduction

Memebase has realized the truly ownerless and costless launch of memecoin through a decentralized protocol. We aim to create an infrastructure that serves the launch and development of memecoin, enabling more memecoins to develop sustainably. We believe memecoins can create great culture and build new organizational relationships that can promote production development for the crypto world and all human beings.
